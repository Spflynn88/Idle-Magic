gather resources event trigger updates the amount of income thats going to happen on the
next update tick. This way all updates still happen together and the trigger isn't a
seperate update type thing.

I'm making a Resource class and over load __add__ so they can be added together

Game currently keeps track of resource income, should that go to manager?
